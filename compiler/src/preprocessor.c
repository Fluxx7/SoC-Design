    two goals: 
    - break down each line into predefined statements
        - outline the statements found in the statements file to make later steps faster
        - this is also needed to safely replace labels, macros, and constants
    - replace all labels, macros, and constants with the equivalent values, and remove comments
        - start with macros, as they can include other macros, labels, and constants, and they will also affect the address of labels
            - loop through and expand each macro found
                - can loop repeatedly and track located macros until no more macros are found
                - better option might be to recursively expand a macro until the macro is fully expanded
            - once no more macros exist, replace all constants with predefined values
            - replace all labels with correct line addresses
    
    Final result should only include assembly instructions that can easily be processed by the primary system
    Support both mirroring and verbosity setttings
